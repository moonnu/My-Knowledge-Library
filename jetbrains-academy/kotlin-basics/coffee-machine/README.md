# Coffee Machine

### Learning outcomes

This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Kotlin. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.



이 프로젝트는 classes 와 같은 주요 개념,  class 메소드 및 속성을 배우며 OOP 개념에 대해 더 잘 이해할 수 있습니다. 함수를 사용하며 연습하고, 반복문과 조건문을 써보며 OOP 의 자신감을 높이세요.



Stage 1/6: Making coffee

Stage 3/6: Estimate the number of servings

Stage 4/6: Buy, fill, take!

Stage 5/6: Keep track of the supplies

Stage 6/6: Brush up your code



### Computer programming

내가 가장 고민하는 언어 선택에 관한 글을 가져왔다 !

#### How to choose a computer language?

When choosing a language, you should ask yourself what sort of work you would like to do. And this brings us to the “make computers **do tasks**” part of the question. Think about why you want to learn to code. Do you want to become a game developer? Do you want to create iPhone apps? Do you want to make websites? Or maybe you need programming to automate work with scientific and statistical data?

So, it’s not really about choosing a language. It’s more about choosing a field. If you want to create Android apps, choose Kotlin; for iOS apps choose Swift, and if you want to develop games, learn C or C++. And if your answer to the question "why" is "to make a lot of money, idk", consider the most popular programming languages and start there.



언어를 선택할 때 나 자신에게 어떤 종류의 일을 하고 싶은지 물어봐야해\
그리고 이건 "컴퓨터가 작업을 하게 만드는 것" 부분으로 우리를 이끌지\
**생각해봐, 넌 왜 코딩을 배우고 싶은 거야?** 게임 개발자가 되고 싶어? 아이폰 앱 개발자가 되고 싶어? 웹사이트를 만들고 싶어? 아니면 과학 및 통계 데이터로 자동화를 하고 싶어서?

아무튼, 언어를 선택하는 게 요점이 아니라 **분야를 선택하는 게 요점**이지. 만약 안드로이드 앱을 만들고 싶다면 Kotlin 을 선택하고, iOS 앱을 선택했다면 Swift를, 게임 개발자면 C 또는 C++을. 그리고 내가 코딩을 배우는 이유가 돈을 많이 벌기 위해서라면 인기 있는 언어를 선택하고 거기서 시작해.



### Introduction to Kotlin

#### What is Kotlin?

Knowledge of Kotlin allows developers to write mobile, server-side, and desktop applications, as well as useful frameworks and libraries. As a general-purpose language, it can be used in many spheres, such as financial services, telecommunications, embedded systems, medicine, development tools (like IntelliJ IDEA), and so on.

#### A multiplatform language

* **JVM:** Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means Kotlin works great with all existing Java code and libraries. It also allows companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin because Java code can access Kotlin code, too. At the same time, developers can use Kotlin as the only language for their projects without Java at all.
* **Android:** using Kotlin, you can create mobile applications for the most used operating system in the world.
* **JS:** Kotlin is also compatible with JavaScript, which enables you to develop client-side web applications and run them in a browser.
* **Native:** Kotlin code can be converted into a file that can be run on any OS such as Windows, Linux, iOS, and macOS.
