# Work on project

##### Description

Just one action is not so interesting, is it? Let's improve the program so it can do multiple actions, one after another. It should repeatedly ask a user what they want to do. If the user types `"buy"`, `"fill"` or `"take"`, then the program should do exactly the same thing it did in the previous step. However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, they should type `"exit"`. The program should terminate on this command. Also, when the user types `"remaining"`, the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has. This means that you shouldn't show the remaining stock levels at the beginning/end of the program.

Remember, that:

- For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
- For the latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
- And for the cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.

##### Objectives

Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given. Introduce two new options: `"remaining"` and `"exit"`.

Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee and state what is missing.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types `"buy"` to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, they should be able to type `"back"` to return into the main cycle.

##### Example

Your coffee machine should have the same initial resources as in the example (*400 ml* of water, *540 ml* of milk, *120 g* of coffee beans, *9* disposable cups, *$550* in cash).

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
